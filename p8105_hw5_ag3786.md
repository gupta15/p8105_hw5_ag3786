Problem 1
=========

These data are from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help
-   Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
-   Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary

``` r
## Creating a list of participant data file names
file_name_list = list.files("./data")

## Creating a function to read the csv files and add the respective file names
read_csv_iteration = function(data_files) {
  subject_data = 
    read_csv(file = str_c("./data/", data_files)) %>% 
    mutate(file = data_files)
}

## Reading in all the files in a combined dataset using a function and tidying the data
data_combined = 
  map_df(file_name_list, read_csv_iteration) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = observation, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(file, into = c("group", "subject"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "week_", ""),
         subject = str_replace(subject,".csv",""),
         group = recode(group, "con" = "control", 
                        "exp" = "experimental"))
```
